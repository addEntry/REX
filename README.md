### Development context

  Beginner in the world of web development, this project is the opportunity to
concretize all the theory that I have learned so far and to approach the good
practices, new technologies...

### Goals

  Feedback form containing the client's name, the project's name, developers who
have to work on it with the possibility of adding them or removing them from the
project.


  The seller element and project manager allows us to know who sold the project
and who was project manager on it.


  Two comment fields (incoming and outgoing) as well as a notation system allow
us to enter remarks.


  The goal, ultimately, will be to output the data entered in Json format and
store its data in a database.
